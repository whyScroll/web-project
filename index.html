    <h1>Famouse film Leonardo DiCaprio</h1>
    <h2>The Wolf Of Wall Street</h2>
    <p>
      Hmm-MMM. Thump-thump. Hmm-MMM. Thump-thump. You could think of DiCaprio’s
      Jordan Belfort, master of the underhanded deed, as Frank ‘Catch Me if You
      Can’ Abagnale Jr’s sinister, city-slicker older brother: utterly amoral,
      ruthless, and with a laser-like focus on extracting cash from anyone
      foolish enough to trust him. He loses his job on Black Monday in 1987, and
      builds himself back up by bullishly inflating the prices of stocks before
      cutting and running with the profits. He becomes a shamanic figure for
      other young, thirsty, horrible brokers – until, in classic Scorsese style,
      he goes too far, and the whole thing starts falling apart. In a career
      full of them, The Wolf Of Wall Street features Scorsese’s finest arrest
      scenes, as the FBI storm into Belfort’s brokerage office to the strains of
      the Lemonheads’ cover of ‘Mrs Robinson’. This deliciously, operatically
      cynical response to the loss of trust after the 2008 financial crash is
      the high point of one of modern cinema’s greatest collabs.
